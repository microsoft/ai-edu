## 2.1 Linear Backpropagation

### 2.1.1 Examples of forward calculation

Suppose there is a function:

$$z = x \cdot y \tag{1}$$

in which:

$$x = 2w + 3b \tag{2}$$

$$y = 2b + 1 \tag{3}$$

The calculation diagram is shown in Figure 2-4.

Figure 2-4 Calculation diagram of simple linear calculation

Note that $x,y,z$ are not variables, but only intermediate calculation results; $w,b$ are variables. As in the values of $w$ and $b$ are what we want to solve for in the neural network studied later, we are drawing your attention to them now. 

When $w = 3, b = 4$, we will get the result shown in Figure 2-5.

<img src="https://aiedugithub4a2.blob.core.windows.net/a2-images/Images/2/flow2.png"/>

Figure 2-5 Calculation result

The final value of $z$ is affected by many factors: variables $w$ and $b$ and formulas $x$ and $y$.

### 2.1.2 Calculate $w$ using backpropagation

#### Calculate the partial derivative of $w$

Currently, $z=162$. If we want to make $z$ smaller, for example, aim to let $z=150$, how will $w$ change? To simplify the problem, consider only changing the value of $w$ and leaving the value of $b$ fixed at $4$.

If you want to solve this problem, the most obvious way is to adjust the input's value little by little, like changing $w$ to $3.5$ and then to $3$...until you are satisfied. Now we are going to learn a better solution: backpropagation.

Starting from $z$ and looking back layer by layer, the calculation results of partial derivatives of each node in the figure with respect to variable $w$ are as follows:

$$z = x \cdot y$$, where $$x = 2w + 3b, y = 2b + 1$$

so we have:

$$\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{w}}=\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} \cdot \frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{w}}=y \cdot 2=18 \tag{4}$$

in which:

$$\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{x}}(x \cdot y)=y=9$$

$$\frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{w}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{w}}(2w+3b)=2$$

<img src="https://aiedugithub4a2.blob.core.windows.net/a2-images/Images/2/flow3.png" />

Figure 2-6 The process of solving partial derivatives of $w$

Figure 2-6 shows the chain rule in action, where the error of $z$ is transmitted to $w$ through the middle $x$. What if, instead of using the chain rule, we directly use the expression of $z$ to calculate the partial derivative of $w$? Let's try it out.

According to formulas 1, 2, and 3, we have:

$$z=x \cdot y=(2w+3b)(2b+1)=4wb+2w+6b^2+3b \tag{5}$$

Calculating the partial derivative of $w$ from the above formula:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial w}=4b+2=4 \cdot 4 + 2=18 \tag{6}
$$

The results of formula 4 and formula 6 are the same! Therefore, we should believe in the scientific nature of the chain rule.

#### Find the specific change value of $w$

The meanings of formula 4 and formula 6 are: when $w$ changes slightly, $z$ will produce a change of 18 times the change value of $w$. Remember that our goal is to make $z=150$. In the current initial state, $z=162$, so the question becomes: When we need to change $z$ from $162$ to $150$, how much does $w$ need to change?

Since:

$$
\Delta z = 18 \cdot \Delta w
$$

then:

$$
\Delta w = {\Delta z \over 18}=\frac{162-150}{18}= 0.6667
$$

so：

$$w = w - 0.6667=2.3333$$
$$x=2w+3b=16.6667$$
$$z=x \cdot y=16.6667 \times 9=150.0003$$

We succeeded in getting the $z$value to $150.0003$, which is very close to the $150$ target. This is where we see the power of the partial derivative.

#### [Class exercise] Calculate the partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $b$ and use the result in the next section

### 2.1.3 Calculate $b$ using backpropagation

#### Calculate the partial derivative of $b$

This time we fixed the value of $w$ to $3$ and changed the value of $b$. The goal is still $z=150$. As in the previous section, first, calculate the partial derivative of $b$.

Note that in the previous section, the derivative of $w$ only traveled one way: from $z$ to $x$ to $w$. However, there are two paths to calculate the derivative of $b$, as shown in Figure 2-7:

1. From $z$ to $x$ to $b$;
2. From $z$ to $y$ to $b$.

<img src="https://aiedugithub4a2.blob.core.windows.net/a2-images/Images/2/flow4.png" />

Figure 2-7 The process of calculating partial derivatives of b

From the compound derivative formula, the two should be additive, so we have:

$$\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{b}}=\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} \cdot \frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{b}}+\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{y}}\cdot\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{b}}=y \cdot 3+x \cdot 2=63 \tag{7}$$

In which:

$$\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{x}}(x \cdot y)=y=9$$
$$\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{y}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{y}}(x \cdot y)=x=18$$
$$\frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{b}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{b}}(2w+3b)=3$$
$$\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{b}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{b}}(2b+1)=2$$

We might as well verify the correctness of chain derivation. Take formula 5 again:

$$z=x \cdot y=(2w+3b)(2b+1)=4wb+2w+6b^2+3b \tag{5}$$

Calculate the partial derivative of b from the above formula:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial b}=4w+12b+3=12+48+3=63 \tag{8}
$$

The result is the same as the chain rule of formula 7.

#### Calculate the specific change value of $b$

The meanings of formula 7 and formula 8 are: when $b$ changes slightly, $z$ will produce a change of $63$ times the change value of $b$. Remember that our goal is to make $z=150$, and the current initial state is $162$. So, the question becomes: when we need $z$ to change from $162$ to $150$, how much does $b$ need to change?

Since we have:

$$\Delta z = 63 \cdot \Delta b$$

then:

$$
\Delta b = \frac{\Delta z}{63}=\frac{162-150}{63}=0.1905
$$

so:
$$
b=b-0.1905=3.8095
$$
$$x=2w+3b=17.4285$$
$$y=2b+1=8.619$$
$$z=x \cdot y=17.4285 \times 8.619=150.2162$$

This result is also very close to $150$, but it is not sufficiently accurate. Iterate the calculation a few more times until the error is less than `1e-4`, upon which we can end the iteration. For computers, these operations are executed very quickly.

#### [Class exercise] Please try to continue iterating twice manually to see how accurate the error can be.

In this problem, if we use a mathematical formula to solve a quadratic equation, can we directly get the accurate b value? Yes! However, we want to explain the method of machine learning because the machine cannot solve the quadratic equation, and in many cases, the real problem cannot be solved by the quadratic equation. The above example shows that machines are good at iterative calculation methods to continually approach the real solution, which is the essence of machine learning! Moreover, this method is universally applicable.

### 2.1.4 Calculate the changes of $w$ and $b$ at the same time

This time we are changing both $w$ and $b$ to achieve the final result of $z=150$.

Given that $\Delta z=12$, let's add half of the error to $w$ and the other half to $b$:

$$\Delta b=\frac{\Delta z / 2}{63} = \frac{12/2}{63}=0.095$$

$$\Delta w=\frac{\Delta z / 2}{18} = \frac{12/2}{18}=0.333$$

- $w = w-\Delta w=3-0.333=2.667$
- $b = b - \Delta b=4-0.095=3.905$
- $x=2w+3b=2 \times 2.667+3 \times 3.905=17.049$
- $y=2b+1=2 \times 3.905+1=8.81$
- $z=x \times y=17.049 \times 8.81=150.2$

#### [Class exercise] Use Python code to implement bivariate backpropagation calculation process

Possible problems:

1. When checking the value of $\Delta z$, be careful to use the absolute value as it may be a negative number
2. When calculating $\Delta b$ and $\Delta w$ for the first time, their contribution to $z$ is $1/63$ and $1/18$ respectively. However, by the second time, due to the change of the value of $b,w$, the contribution value to $z$ will also have a slight change, so it needs to be recalculated. The specific explanation is as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{b}}=\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} \cdot \frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{b}}+\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{y}}\cdot\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{b}}=y \cdot 3+x \cdot 2=3y+2x
$$
$$
\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{w}}=\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{x}} \cdot \frac{\partial{x}}{\partial{w}}+\frac{\partial{z}}{\partial{y}}\cdot\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{w}}=y \cdot 2+x \cdot 0 = 2y
$$
Therefore, in each iteration, the following two values must be recalculated:
$$
\Delta b=\frac{\Delta z}{3y+2x}
$$
$$
\Delta w=\frac{\Delta z}{2y}
$$

Here is the result of running the program.

The contribution value of $\Delta b$ is not recalculated in the iteration:
```
single variable: b -----
w=3.000000,b=4.000000,z=162.000000,delta_z=12.000000
delta_b=0.190476
w=3.000000,b=3.809524,z=150.217687,delta_z=0.217687
delta_b=0.003455
w=3.000000,b=3.806068,z=150.007970,delta_z=0.007970
delta_b=0.000127
w=3.000000,b=3.805942,z=150.000294,delta_z=0.000294
delta_b=0.000005
w=3.000000,b=3.805937,z=150.000011,delta_z=0.000011
delta_b=0.000000
w=3.000000,b=3.805937,z=150.000000,delta_z=0.000000
done!
final b=3.805937
```
The contribution of $\Delta b$is recalculated in each iteration:
```
single variable new: b -----
w=3.000000,b=4.000000,z=162.000000,delta_z=12.000000
factor_b=63.000000, delta_b=0.190476
w=3.000000,b=3.809524,z=150.217687,delta_z=0.217687
factor_b=60.714286, delta_b=0.003585
w=3.000000,b=3.805938,z=150.000077,delta_z=0.000077
factor_b=60.671261, delta_b=0.000001
w=3.000000,b=3.805937,z=150.000000,delta_z=0.000000
done!
final b=3.805937
```
From the comparison of the above two results, we can see three points:

1. 'factor_b' is' 63 'the first time and decreases a little each iteration.
2. The second function ends after three iterations, while the first function ends after five iterations. The second function is more efficient.
3. The result is the same because this problem has only one solution.

For iterations with two variables, the same problem exists:

The contribution value of $\Delta b,\Delta w$ is not recalculated in the iteration (`factor_b` and `factor_w` always keep `63` and `18` each time):
```
double variable: w, b -----
w=3.000000,b=4.000000,z=162.000000,delta_z=12.000000
delta_b=0.095238, delta_w=0.333333
w=2.666667,b=3.904762,z=150.181406,delta_z=0.181406
delta_b=0.001440, delta_w=0.005039
w=2.661628,b=3.903322,z=150.005526,delta_z=0.005526
delta_b=0.000044, delta_w=0.000154
w=2.661474,b=3.903278,z=150.000170,delta_z=0.000170
delta_b=0.000001, delta_w=0.000005
w=2.661469,b=3.903277,z=150.000005,delta_z=0.000005
done!
final b=3.903277
final w=2.661469
```

The contribution value of $\Delta b,\Delta w$ is recalculated in each iteration (`factor_b` and `factor_w` change each time):
```
double variable new: w, b -----
w=3.000000,b=4.000000,z=162.000000,delta_z=12.000000
factor_b=63.000000, factor_w=18.000000, delta_b=0.095238, delta_w=0.333333
w=2.666667,b=3.904762,z=150.181406,delta_z=0.181406
factor_b=60.523810, factor_w=17.619048, delta_b=0.001499, delta_w=0.005148
w=2.661519,b=3.903263,z=150.000044,delta_z=0.000044
factor_b=60.485234, factor_w=17.613053, delta_b=0.000000, delta_w=0.000001
w=2.661517,b=3.903263,z=150.000000,delta_z=0.000000
done!
final b=3.903263
final w=2.661517
```
The difference between this and the first univariate iteration is that this problem can have multiple solutions so that both methods can get their respective correct solutions. However, the second method is more efficient and satisfies the concept of gradient descent.
