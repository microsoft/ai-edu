## 2.2 Non-linear Backpropagation

### 2.2.1 Ask a question

In the linear example above, we can find that the error is passed to the initial value $w$ and $b$, i.e., it directly modifies the values of $w$ and $b$ in just one step to achieve error correction. The graph shows that no matter how complicated the intermediate calculation is, it is still linear so that the error can be passed to the end at once. The disadvantage is that this linear combination can only solve linear problems and cannot solve more complex issues. We have already explained this in the basic neural network principles, which requires an activation function to connect two linear units.

Let's look at a non-linear example, as shown in Figure 2-8.

Fig. 2-8 Non-linear backpropagation

We have $1<x<=10,0<y<2.15$. Suppose there are 5 people representing $x,a,b,c,y$:

#### Forward process

1. The first person, or the input layer, randomly enters the first $x$ value, the value range of which is $(1,10)$, assuming the first number is $2$;
2. The second person or the first-layer network calculation, receives the value of $x$ passed on by the first person and calculates: $a=x^2$;
3. The third person, or the second-layer network calculation, receives the value of $a$ passed on by the second person and calculates: $b=\ln (a)$;
4. The fourth person, or the third-layer network calculation, receives the value of $b$ passed on by the third person and calculates: $c=\sqrt{b}$;
5. The fifth person, or the output layer, receives the value of $c$ passed on by the fourth person

#### Reverse process

6. The fifth person calculates the difference between $y$ and $c$: $\Delta c = c-y$, and returns it to the fourth person
7. The fourth person receives the return from the fifth person $\Delta c$ and calculates $\Delta b = \Delta c \cdot 2\sqrt{b}$
8. The third person receives the return from the fourth person $\Delta b$ and calculates $\Delta a = \Delta b \cdot a$
9. The second person receives the return from the thrid person $\Delta a$ and calculates $\Delta x = \frac{\Delta}{2x}$
10. The first person receives the return from the second person $\Delta x$ and updates $x \leftarrow x-\Delta x$. Return to step 1.

Question: Suppose we want to make $c=2.13$ in the end, what should the value of $x$ be? (The error should be less than $0.001$)

### 2.2.2 Mathematical solution

$$c=\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{\ln(a)}=\sqrt{\ln(x^2)}=2.13$$
$$x = 9.6653$$

### 2.2.3 Gradient iterative solution

$$
\frac{da}{dx}=\frac{d(x^2)}{dx}=2x=\frac{\Delta a}{\Delta x} \tag{1}
$$
$$
\frac{db}{da} =\frac{d(\ln{a})}{da} =\frac{1}{a} = \frac{\Delta b}{\Delta a} \tag{2}
$$
$$
\frac{dc}{db}=\frac{d(\sqrt{b})}{db}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{b}}=\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta b} \tag{3}
$$
Therefore, the following set of formulas can be obtained, which backpropagates the error of the last layer of $\Delta c$ to the first $\Delta x$, thereby updating the value of $x$:
$$
\Delta c = c - y \tag{4}
$$
$$
\Delta b = \Delta c \cdot 2\sqrt{b}  \tag{According to formula 3}
$$
$$
\Delta a = \Delta b \cdot a  \tag{According to formula 2}
$$
$$
\Delta x = \Delta a / 2x \tag{According to formula 1}
$$

We make the initial value $x=2$, $\Delta x=0$, and the calculation results are shown in Table 2-2.

Table 2-2 Forward and reverse iterative calculation

|Direction|Formula|1st iteration|2nd iteration|3rd iteration|4th iteration|5th iteration|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Forward|$x=x-\Delta x$|2|4.243|7.344|9.295|9.665|
|Forward|$a=x^2$|4|18.005|53.934|86.404|93.233|
|Forward|$b=\ln(a)$|1.386|2.891|3.988|4.459|4.535|
|Forward|$c=\sqrt{b}$|1.177|1.700|1.997|2.112|2.129|
||Label value y|2.13|2.13|2.13|2.13|2.13|
|Reverse|$\Delta c = c - y$|-0.953|-0.430|-0.133|-0.018||
|Reverse|$\Delta b = \Delta c \cdot 2\sqrt{b}$|-2.243|-1.462|-0.531|-0.078||
|Reverse|$\Delta a = \Delta b \cdot a$|-8.973|-26.317|-28.662|-6.698||
|Reverse|$\Delta x = \Delta a / 2x$|-2.243|-3.101|-1.951|-0.360||

In Table 2-2, first observe that the "1st iteration" column, from top to bottom, is a complete forward and reverse process. The value in the last row is $-2.243$, which contributes to the first row of the "2nd iteration" column, as $2-(-2.243)=4.243$, and then so on. In the fifth round, the $c$ obtained by forwarding calculation is 2.129$, which is very close to $2.13$, so the iteration ends.

Run the sample code to get the following results:

```
how to play: 1) input x, 2) calculate c, 3) input target number but not faraway from c
input x as initial number(1.2,10), you can try 1.3:
2
c=1.177410
input y as target number(0.5,2), you can try 1.8:
2.13
forward...
x=2.000000,a=4.000000,b=1.386294,c=1.177410
backward...
delta_c=-0.952590, delta_b=-2.243178, delta_a=-8.972712, delta_x=-2.243178
......
forward...
x=9.655706,a=93.232666,b=4.535098,c=2.129577
backward...
done!
```

For purposes of concision, only the results of the first step and the last step (step 5) are listed. At the first step, 'c=1.177410' and at the final step, 'c=2.129577'; thus, the iteration is stopped.
