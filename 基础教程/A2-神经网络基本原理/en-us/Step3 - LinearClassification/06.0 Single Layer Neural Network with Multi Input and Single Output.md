# Chapter 6 Neural Network with Multi Input and Single Output -Linear Binary Classification

## 6.0 Linear Binary Classification Problem

### 6.0.1 Raising Questions

In a Chinese chessboard, the Chu-Han border separates the two rival camps, and the prototype of this model is the Chu-Han rivalry around 206 BC. The geographical location of the cities under Liu Bang and Xiang Yu in the Central Plains at that time is shown in Figure 6-1, and part of the sample data is shown in Table 6-1.

Table 6-1 Data Sampling

|Sample Number|$X_1$:Relative value of longitude|$X_2$:Relative value of latitude|$Y$:1=Han, 0=Chu|  
|---|---|---|---|
|1|0.325|0.888|1|
|2|0.656|0.629|0|
|3|0.151|0.101|1|
|4|0.785|0.024|0|
|...|...|...|...|
|200|0.631|0.001|0|

We learned the feature normalization method in the previous chapter. In this example, the latitude and longitude coordinates of the Central Plains should be a real number of two or more digits, such as $(35.234, -122.455)$. To simplify the problem, we have normalized them to between $[0,1]$.  

Questions：

1. If the relative coordinates of latitude and longitude are $(0.58,0.92)$, does it belong to Chu or Han?
2. If the relative latitude and longitude coordinates are $(0.62,0.55)$, does it belong to Chu or Han?
3. If the relative latitude and longitude coordinates are $(0.39,0.29)$, does it belong to Chu or Han?

Readers may think that this is too simple. There is a map, right? After locating the coordinate values and comparing them on the graph, you can find the corresponding area at once. But we need to use machine learning to solve this simple problem so that the future prediction behaviour is fast and accurate instead of requiring slow comparison of a ruler to the graph.

Also, in the principle of using simple examples to illustrate complex principles, we use this seemingly simple example to give the reader visual clarity of both the problem and the solution. Such issues that can be visualized are not common in real production environments.

### 6.0.2 Logistic regression model

Regression problems can be divided into two categories: linear regression and logical regression. In Step 2, we learned about Linear Regression models, and we will learn about Logistic Regression models in Step 3.

In logistic regression, the regression gives the result as the probability of success or failure of an event. We should use logistic regression when the type of the dependent variable is a binary (1/0, true/false, yes/no) variable.

Linear regression uses a straight line to fit the sample data, while logistic regression aims to "fit" two values of 0 or 1, rather than specific continuous values, which is why it is called a generalized linear model. Logistic regression, also known as logistic regression analysis, is commonly used in data mining, automatic disease diagnosis, economic forecasting, and other fields.

For example, one use is to explore the risk factors that cause a disease and predict the probability of contracting a disease based on applicable risk factors. Take the analysis of gastric cancer as an example. Two groups of people are selected, one is the gastric cancer group, and the other is the non-gastric cancer group, and the two groups must have different physical qualities and lifestyles. Therefore, the dependent variable is whether they have gastric cancer or not, and the value is "yes" or "no"; the independent variables can include many, such as age, gender, dietary habits,  Helicobacter pylori infections, etc.

The independent variables can be either continuous or categorical. Then, through logistic regression analysis, the weights of the independent variables can be obtained to get a general idea of which factors are actually risk factors for stomach cancer. Also, the likelihood of a person developing cancer can be predicted according to the weighted risk factors.

Logistic regression is also called the classifier, which is divided into linear classifiers and non-linear classifiers, and in this chapter, we will study linear classifiers. Both linear and non-linear classifiers are divided into binary classification problems and multi-classification problems, and in this chapter, we will learn binary classification problems. The linear multi-classification problem will be described in the next chapter, and the non-linear classification problem will be covered in the subsequent steps.

In summary, this chapter will address the following topics in this order: regression problem -> logistic regression problem -> linear logistic regression i.e. classification problem -> linear binary classification problem.

Table 6-2 illustrates the difference between linear and non-linear binary classification.

Table 6-2 provides an intuitive understanding of the differences between linear and non-linear binary classification.

We will first learn how to solve linear binary classifications, after which we can expand to discussing non-linear binary classification problems.
