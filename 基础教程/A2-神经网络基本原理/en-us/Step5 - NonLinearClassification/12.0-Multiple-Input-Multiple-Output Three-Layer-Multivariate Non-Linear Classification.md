# Chapter 12 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Three-Layer Neural Network - Deep Non-linear Multi-Classification

## 12.0 Multivariate non-linear multi-classification

### 12.0.1 Raising the question

Handwriting recognition is one of the essential topics in artificial intelligence. Here are some samples of the MNIST digital handwriting recognition image set, which you must not be unfamiliar with.

Figure 12-1 Example of the MNIST dataset sample

Since this is data collected from European and American countries and regions, several points can be seen in the figure that is different from the handwriting habits of the Chinese.

- Number 2, with an extra circle underneath
- Number 4, many horizontal lines do not pass the vertical line
- Number 6, the top is straight
- Number 7, with a horizontal bar in the middle

However, these details do not affect our study, and it is an excellent opportunity to verify whether Chinese handwriting habits can be correctly recognized.

Since we are not asked to recognize 26 English letters or more than 3500 common Chinese characters, the problem is quite simple. It does not require knowledge of image processing or the involvement of convolutional neural networks for the time being. Let's try to solve this problem with a three-layer neural network, looking at each image pixel as a vector instead of as a dot matrix.

#### Normalization of image data

In Chapter 5, we learned about data normalization, which is the processing for the feature values of the data, that is, the processing for the columns of the sample data.

In this chapter, the object to be processed is an image, and the whole image needs to be treated as a sample, so the following code is used to do the data normalization method.

```Python
    def __NormalizeData(self, XRawData):
        X_NEW = np.zeros(XRawData.shape)
        x_max = np.max(XRawData)
        x_min = np.min(XRawData)
        X_NEW = (XRawData - x_min)/(x_max-x_min)
        return X_NEW
```
