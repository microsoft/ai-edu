# Step 7: Deep Neural Networks

## Summary

In previous steps, we used simple cases to gradually learn a lot of knowledge, making it easier for us to touch upon deep learning.

Starting from this step, we will discuss some details of deep learning. This includes weight matrix initialization, gradient descent optimization algorithms, batch normalization, and other advanced concepts.

Due to the strong learning ability of the deep network, it will cause the network to overfit the sample data, resulting in insufficient generalization abilities. Therefore, we need some means to improve the generalization ability of the network.
